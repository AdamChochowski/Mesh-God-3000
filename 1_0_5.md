## [1.0.5] – 2025-09-21  
### Undo & Selection Overhaul

**Summary:**  
Completely rewrote the Undo system. It now merges with Unity’s built-in Undo, blocks selection of other GameObjects while the tool is active, and fully supports all mesh operations including Separate and Pivot changes.

---

### 🟢 Added
- **Full Undo Support** – Now covers all mesh operations, including *Separate*, *Pivot adjustments*, and *selection changes*.  
- **Custom Icon** – Added a new icon for the *Mesh God 3000* tool.

### 🟡 Changed / Improved
- **Locked Selection** – Prevents accidental changes to other GameObjects while the tool is active.  
- **SeparateByLooseParts** – Now separates only among selected triangles, ignoring unselected mesh regions.  
- **Undo System Integration** – Merged previous “Undo Selection” with Unity’s Undo for a smoother, unified workflow.
